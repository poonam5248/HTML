<h5> Dear Rodney: </h5>
<p> This is further to our meeting of last week at which we agreed to hold a series of meetings over the next<br> two months to review your experiences with the pilot implementation of the 1to1 Customer<br> Relationship Management Program. </p>
<p>As discussed at that meeting, the objectives of our review sessions will be to: </p>
<ul>
<li> Review and assess the overall effectiveness of the program;</li>
<li>Identify and document strengths weaknesses of the program; </li>
<li>Propose customer-focused solutions to address areas of weakness; </li>
<li> Develop an approach and action plan for Phase 2 of the project;</li>
<li>Determine the staff members who will make up the Phase 2 Team. </li>
</ul>
<p> 
As agreed, meetings will be held every second Tuesday from 9:00 a.m. until noon, and the location will<br> alternate between our two offices, the first one to be convened here at Inter-Office on August 14, 20xx.<br> Fred Johnson of your CRM group is to act as the meeting co-ordinator and recording secretary <br>throughout the process. 
</p>
<p>As discussed, at the end of the process, Deborah Buxton of Consultek will draft the summary report for<br> review by the steering committee. As you requested, a copy of her c.v. has been enclosed. 
</p>
<p> I trust I have covered all of the points that we discussed. If you have any questions or would like to add <br>anything please give me a call at 745-9878. We look forward to seeing you at the August 14th meeting.
