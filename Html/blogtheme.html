    <h2>As New Turnaround King, Is HP Better Than Apple?</h2>
     <img src="https://www.technewsworld.com/article_images/story_graphics_xlarge/xl-2017-hp-headquarters-1.jpg">
    <p>HP is the new turnaround king -- but is it better than Apple? IBM was the king of tech in the 1980s, but in the 1990s it was the king of turnarounds, after almost going under but coming back from a negative brand equity, which occurs when folks will pay more for a no-name product than one with a negative brand. Apple, at the end of the 90s, was in much the same shape IBM was at the beginning.</p>

    <h2>The New iPhones: Apple's Strangely Wrongheaded Pivot</h2>
     <img src="https://www.technewsworld.com/article_images/story_graphics_xlarge/xl-2017-iphone8-plus-1.jpg">
    <p>It fascinates me that succession from a successful CEO to the chosen successor almost always goes badly. This phenomenon isn't limited to the CEO level -- I've seen highly successful CMOs followed by handpicked successors who also seem to have no clue as to why their predecessor did so well. I think it comes down to a lack of mentoring combined with misconceptions.</p>

    <h2>Twitter to Test Drive Double-Wide Tweets</h2>
    <img src="https://www.technewsworld.com/article_images/story_graphics_xlarge/xl-2016-tweet-1.jpg">
    <p>Twitter has announced a limited test to double the maximum tweet size to 280 characters. Twitter has been struggling to boost user engagement, and its tweet character limitation has been the subject of a longstanding debate among customers and company insiders. One reason for the possible change is to correct for the information imbalance between Asian and western language characters.</p>
